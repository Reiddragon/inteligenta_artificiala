# Uni assignments only

This repo is entirely made up of uni assignments, thus nothing interesting unless you're looking for "inspiration" or are my teacher

## Contents
- Piano Tiles Bot - Windows-only, supposed to make it able to also click on
some presents or something but I can't run Windows at a decent enough speed to
actually get to the presents so that'll have to wait until I port it to
[Linux](https://stallman-copypasta.github.io/) so I can actually run the game
at more than 10fps

- Car Registration Plate Reader
    - takes in an image of a car as a command line argument, looks for the registration plate, then tries to read it
    - sometimes succeeds in finding the plate in the image but fails to properly read it
